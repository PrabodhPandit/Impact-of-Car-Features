Analyzing the Impact of Car Features on Price and Profitability

The automotive industry has been rapidly evolving over the past few decades, with a growing focus on fuel efficiency, environmental sustainability, and technological innovation. With increasing competition among manufacturers and a changing consumer landscape, it has become more important than ever to understand the factors that drive consumer demand for cars.
In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards electric and hybrid vehicles and increased interest in alternative fuel sources such as hydrogen and natural gas. At the same time, traditional gasoline-powered cars remain dominant in the market, with varying fuel types and grades available to consumers.
For the given dataset, the client has asked How can a car manufacturer optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand?
This problem could be approached by analyzing the relationship between a car's features, market category, and pricing, and identifying which features and categories are most popular among consumers and most profitable for the manufacturer. By using data analysis techniques such as regression analysis and market segmentation, the manufacturer could develop a pricing strategy that balances consumer demand with profitability, and identify which product features to focus on in future product development efforts. This could help the manufacturer improve its competitiveness in the market and increase its profitability over time.

The dataset contains information on over 11,000 car models and their specifications, including details on the car's make, model, year, fuel type, engine power, transmission, wheels, number of doors, market category, size, style, estimated miles per gallon, popularity, and manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP), and is titled "Car Features and MSRP". It was collected and made available on Kaggle by Cooper Union, a private college located in New York City.

Here is a brief overview of the dataset:

● Number of observations: 11,914

● Number of variables: 16

● File type: CSV (Comma Separated Values)

The variables in the dataset are:

● Make: the make or brand of the car

● Model: the specific model of the car

● Year: the year the car was released

● Engine Fuel Type: the type of fuel used by the car (gasoline, diesel, etc.)

● Engine HP: the horsepower of the car's engine

● Engine Cylinders: the number of cylinders in the car's engine

● Transmission Type: the type of transmission (automatic or manual)

● Driven_Wheels: the type of wheels driven by the car (front, rear, all)

● Number of Doors: the number of doors the car has

● Market Category: the market category the car belongs to (Luxury, Performance, etc.)

● Vehicle Size: the size of the car

● Vehicle Style: the style of the car (Sedan, Coupe, etc.)

● Highway MPG: the estimated miles per gallon the car gets on the highway

● City MPG: the estimated miles per gallon the car gets in the city

● Popularity: a ranking of the popularity of the car (based on the number of times it has been viewed on Edmunds.com)

● MSRP: the manufacturer's suggested retail price of the car

This dataset could be useful for a variety of data analysis tasks, such as:

● Exploring trends in car features and pricing over time

● Comparing the fuel efficiency of different types of cars

● Investigating the relationship between a car's features and its popularity

● Predicting the price of a car based on its features and market category

This dataset is a valuable resource in exploring various aspects of the automotive industry and could provide insights that could inform decisions related to product development, marketing, and pricing.
By answering the below questions and building an interactive dashboard, we can provide valuable insights to a car manufacturer and help them optimize their
pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand.

1 How does the popularity of a car model vary across different market
categories?
2 What is the relationship between a car's engine power and its price?
3 Which car features are most important in determining a car's price?
4 How does the average price of a car vary across different manufacturers?
5 What is the relationship between fuel efficiency and the number of cylinders in a car's engine?
6 How does the distribution of car prices vary by brand and body style?
7 Which car brands have the highest and lowest average MSRPs, and how does this vary by body style?
8 How do the different feature such as transmission type affect the MSRP, and how does this vary by body style?
9 How does the fuel efficiency of cars vary across different body styles and model years?
10 How does the car's horsepower, MPG, and price vary across different Brands?
